Protocol for image naming and file path.

Folder names dictate what the files are.
Images are overlapped to achieve a certain look.

folder heirarchy  
	armor—>
		basic
		bronze	
		platinum 
	arms—>
		withWeapon—>
			animated
			still
		withoutWeapon—>
			animated
			still
	playerSkeleton 
	teamColor—>
		red
		blue

In each folder there are 4 different images that represent the look of each part of the final image:
	facing_backwards.png
	facing_forwards.png
	facing_left.png
	facing_right.png

ex. “armor/platinum/facing_left.png“
This is an image for platinum armor when the player is facing left
